game is: you go left and right to dodge obstacles and collect bubbles as your health goes down

always have whales swimming in background except for in tunnel



you get to a certain point where mine productivity slows down and then it's like you're going through a tunnel,
there are parts of the tunnel blocking you, falling boulders, and eels attacking you at the sides (tunnel has only boulders, eels, and mines)
and you pop up where it's sandy like main menu screen, but different this time and there is light shining from above as if you are close to surface
as you go up you start to see less and less background
when the background art is kinda gone you start to see shadows of far away whales and schools of fishies in background

obstacles in order of appearance
  mines
  falling rocks - small, big
  sharks - swim horizontally (but makes sense w the background)
  puffer fish  - puffs up if you get too close
  eel - shocks and slows you
