quick overview of object oriented style health bar

BarScript - the script that has the properties:
        content (image)
        fillAmount (float used to set )
        Value (encapsulated property set with a map that sets fillAmount to the right ratio for the barscript image)
        MaxValue (encapsulated property to store max value of the fill amount)

Stat - not attached to anything, called in the PlayerScript. this is reusable Class for each stat!
    it is not a monobehavior, it just says public Class Stat at the top of it.
    from another script, you can say Private Stat oxygen; or Private Stat health; and it creates the
    stat with the following properties:
        BarScript as bar (the one described above) which you have to drag the item to (in our case, Level1/Canvas/OxygenBar)
        MaxVal (encapsulated property to store max value of the stat and update bar's MaxValue)
        CurrentVal (encapsulated property to store current value of the stat and update bar's Value)
    and the following method:
        Initialize (this is called in PlayerScript's private Awake())

PlayerScript - attached to the player and starts by initializing a class object Stat with the name oxygen in our case
    The oxygen stat's initialize function is called right away with private void Awake() {oxygen.Initialize();}
    void Update () {} contains everything that affects the stat
    for example: you can change the oxygen Stat's CurrentVal property with oxygen.CurrentVal += 10;
    this calls oxygen.CurrentVal.set with 10 as the value which updates the stat's currentval (private) and the bar's Value
    Value then changes fillAmount which causes an update to the image.

    COOL OMG JEEZ
